## Usage

  On the first run program will create settings.ini file where you can input all JIRA credentials (url, username, api token) and project you want to export.

[settings.ini](docs/settings.ini):

```ini
[JIRA_ACCESS]
jira_base_url = https://your_jira_instance/  #Here you should put url from your JIRA
jira_username = your_jira@username  #JIRA username
jira_api_token = your_jira_api_token #Jira API token -> look into https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/ on how to obtain API token.

[EXPORT_OPTIONS]
export_path = EXPORT/ #Folder to export files. Relative to path executing program.
save_to_html = True #Exports html files from JIRA issues
save_to_pdf = True #Exports pdf files from JIRA issue

[ISSUE_FILTER]
jira_project = TEST #Jira project from all issues will be imported
```

After correctly setting up your data, run program and it will export issues into provided folder (EXPORT as default).

Depending on the options selected program will:
+ Always download all attachments from issues with filename changed to 'Issue-number'-'filename'
+ If save_to_html=True will generate html file for each issue with filename being 'Issue-number'
+ If save_to_pdf=True will generate pdf file for each issue with filename being 'Issue-number'

- {Issue_Number}
- {Issue_Name}
- {Issue_Description}
- {Comments}
  - {Comment_date}
  - {Comment_author}
  - {Comment_body}
- {Attachments}
  - Links to attachments locally downloaded.
